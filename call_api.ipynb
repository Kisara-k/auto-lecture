Attributes ◼Attribute (or dimensions, features, variables): a data field, representing a characteristic or feature of a data object. ◼E.g., customer _ID, name, address ◼Types: ◼Nominal ◼Binary ◼Numeric: quantitative ◼Interval-scaled ◼Ratio-scaled Attribute Types ◼Nominal: categories, states, or “names of things” Hair_color = {auburn, black, blond, brown, grey, red, white} marital status, occupation, ID numbers, zip codes ◼Binary Nominal attribute with only 2 states (0 and 1) Symmetric binary: both outcomes equally important e.g., gender Asymmetric binary: outcomes not equally important. e.g., medical test (positive vs. negative) Convention: assign 1 to most important outcome (e.g., HIV positive) ◼Ordinal Values have a meaningful order (ranking) but magnitude between successive values is not known. Size = {small, medium, large}, grades, army rankings Numeric Attribute Types ◼Quantity (integer or real-valued) ◼Interval Measured on a scale of equal-sized units Values have order E.g., temperature in C˚or F˚, calendar dates No true zero-point ◼Ratio Inherent zero-point We can speak of values as being an order of magnitude larger than the unit of measurement (10 K˚ is twice as high as 5 K˚). e.g., temperature in Kelvin, length, counts, monetary quantities Discrete vs. Continuous Attributes ◼Discrete Attribute ◼Has only a finite or countably infinite set of values ◼E.g., zip codes, profession, or the set of words in a collection of documents ◼Sometimes, represented as integer variables ◼Note: Binary attributes are a special case of discrete attributes ◼Continuous Attribute ◼Has real numbers as attribute values ◼E.g., temperature, height, or weight ◼Practically, real values can only be measured and represented using a finite number of digits ◼Continuous attributes are typically represented as floating-point variables Chapter 2: Getting to Know Your Data ◼Data Objects and Attribute Types ◼Basic Statistical Descriptions of Data ◼Data Visualization ◼Measuring Data Similarity and Dissimilarity ◼Summary Basic Statistical Descriptions of Data ◼Motivation ◼To better understand the data: central tendency, variation and spread ◼Data dispersion characteristics ◼median, max, min, quantiles, outliers, variance, etc. ◼Numerical dimensions correspond to sorted intervals ◼Data dispersion: analyzed with multiple granularities of precision ◼Boxplot or quantile analysis on sorted intervals ◼Dispersion analysis on computed measures ◼Folding measures into numerical dimensions ◼Boxplot or quantile analysis on the transformed cube Measuring the Central Tendency Mean (algebraic measure) (sample vs. population): Note: n is sample size and N is population size. ◼Weighted arithmetic mean: ◼Trimmed mean: chopping extreme values Median: ◼Middle value if odd number of values, or average of the middle two values otherwise ◼Estimated by interpolation (for grouped data): Mode ◼Value that occurs most frequently in the data ◼Unimodal, bimodal, trimodal ◼Empirical formula: width freq freq median median median mean mode mean Symmetric vs. Skewed Data ◼Median, mean and mode of symmetric, positively and negatively skewed data positively skewed negatively skewed symmetric Measuring the Dispersion of Data Quartiles, outliers and boxplots ◼Quartiles: Q1 (25th percentile), Q3 (75th percentile) ◼Inter-quartile range: IQR = Q3 - Q1 ◼Five number summary: min, Q1, median, Q3, max ◼Boxplot: ends of the box are the quartiles; median is marked; add whiskers, and plot outliers individually ◼Outlier: usually, a value higher/lower than 1.5 x IQR Variance and standard deviation (sample: s, population: σ) ◼Variance: (algebraic, scalable computation) ◼Standard deviation s (or σ) is the square root of variance s2 (or σ2) Boxplot Analysis Five-number summary of a distribution ◼Minimum, Q1, Median, Q3, Maximum Boxplot ◼Data is represented with a box ◼The ends of the box are at the first and third quartiles, i.e., the height of the box is IQR ◼The median is marked by a line within the box ◼Whiskers: two lines outside the box extended to Minimum and Maximum ◼Outliers: points beyond a specified outlier threshold, plotted individually Visualization of Data Dispersion: 3-D Boxplots Properties of Normal Distribution Curve ◼The normal (distribution) curve ◼From μ-σ to μ+σ: contains about 68% of the measurements (μ: mean, σ: standard deviation) ◼ From μ-2σ to μ+2σ: contains about 95% of it ◼From μ-3σ to μ+3σ: contains about 99.7% of it Graphic Displays of Basic Statistical Descriptions ◼Boxplot: graphic display of five-number summary ◼Histogram: x-axis are values, y-axis repres. frequencies ◼Quantile plot: each value xi is paired with fi indicating that approximately 100 fi % of data are  xi ◼Quantile-quantile (q-q) plot: graphs the quantiles of one univariant distribution against the corresponding quantiles of another ◼Scatter plot: each pair of values is a pair of coordinates and plotted as points in the plane Histogram Analysis Histogram: Graph display of tabulated frequencies, shown as bars It shows what proportion of cases fall into each of several categories Differs from a bar chart in that it is the area of the bar that denotes the value, not the height as in bar charts, a crucial distinction when the categories are not of uniform width The categories are usually specified as non-overlapping intervals of some variable. The categories (bars) must be adjacent Histograms Often Tell More than Boxplots ◼The two histograms shown in the left may have the same boxplot representation ◼The same values for: min, Q1, median, Q3, max ◼But they have rather different data distributions Quantile Plot ◼Displays all of the data (allowing the user to assess both the overall behavior and unusual occurrences) ◼Plots quantile information ◼For a data xi data sorted in increasing order, fi indicates that approximately 100 fi% of the data are below or equal to the value xi Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) Plot Graphs the quantiles of one univariate distribution against the corresponding quantiles of another View: Is there is a shift in going from one distribution to another? Example shows unit price of items sold at Branch 1 vs. Branch 2 for each quantile. Unit prices of items sold at Branch 1 tend to be lower than those at Branch 2. Scatter plot ◼Provides a first look at bivariate data to see clusters of points, outliers, etc ◼Each pair of values is treated as a pair of coordinates and plotted as points in the plane Positively and Negatively Correlated Data The left half fragment is positively correlated The right half is negative correlated Uncorrelated Data Chapter 2: Getting to Know Your Data ◼Data Objects and Attribute Types ◼Basic Statistical Descriptions of Data ◼Data Visualization ◼Measuring Data Similarity and Dissimilarity ◼Summary Data Visualization Why data visualization?
