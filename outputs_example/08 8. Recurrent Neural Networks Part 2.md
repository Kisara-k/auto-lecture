Certainly! Below is a **detailed, well-organized, and clear study note** based on the lecture content you provided on **Recurrent Neural Networks Part 2**. I have expanded explanations, clarified key concepts, and structured the note for easy understanding. Emojis and numbering are used for clarity as requested.



## 1. üîÑ Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) Recap

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network designed specifically to handle **sequential data** ‚Äî data where the order of inputs matters, such as sentences, time series, or speech. Unlike traditional neural networks that treat each input independently, RNNs **remember information from previous inputs** to influence the current output. This memory is crucial because, in sequences, the meaning or prediction at one point often depends on what came before.

#### Why do we need RNNs for sequences?

When analyzing sequences, we often want to consider not just the current input but also the entire history of past inputs. For example, in language modeling, predicting the next word depends on all the previous words. To capture this, RNNs use **recurrent hidden states** that carry information forward through time steps.

#### How do RNNs work mathematically?

At each time step \( t \), the RNN updates its hidden state \( h_t \) based on the current input \( x_t \) and the previous hidden state \( h_{t-1} \):

\[
h_t = \tanh(W_h h_{t-1} + W_x x_t)
\]

Here, \( W_h \) and \( W_x \) are weight matrices learned during training, and \( \tanh \) is a nonlinear activation function that squashes values between -1 and 1.

The output probability for the next element in the sequence (e.g., the next word) is computed by applying a softmax function to a linear transformation of the hidden state:

\[
P(y_{t+1}) = \text{Softmax}(W_y h_t)
\]

The network is trained by minimizing the loss function, typically the cross-entropy loss between the predicted output \( \hat{y}_t \) and the true output \( y_t \):

\[
\mathcal{L} = - \sum_t y_t \log \hat{y}_t
\]

#### Key points about RNN states:

- The hidden state \( h_t \) acts as a **summary of all past inputs** up to time \( t \).
- The initial hidden state \( h_0 \) must be defined (often initialized as zeros).
- Because the same weights are used at every time step, the network can, in theory, remember information from arbitrarily far in the past.

#### Variants of RNNs:

- **One-to-Many:** One input produces a sequence of outputs (e.g., image captioning).
- **Many-to-One:** A sequence of inputs produces a single output (e.g., sentiment classification).
- **Many-to-Many:** Sequences of inputs and outputs (e.g., machine translation).

#### Bi-Directional RNNs

Sometimes, the output at time \( t \) depends not only on past inputs but also on future inputs. For example, in speech recognition, understanding a sound might depend on the next few sounds or words. To handle this, **Bidirectional RNNs** process the sequence in both forward and backward directions, combining information from past and future to improve predictions.



## 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Gradient Issues in RNNs

Training RNNs involves backpropagation through time (BPTT), where gradients are propagated backward through many time steps. However, this process often suffers from two major problems:

- **Vanishing gradients:** Gradients become very small as they are propagated backward, making it difficult for the network to learn long-range dependencies.
- **Exploding gradients:** Gradients become excessively large, causing unstable updates.

#### Why do these problems occur?

The hidden state update involves repeated multiplication by the weight matrix \( W_h \) and the derivative of the activation function (like \( \tanh \)). Over many time steps, these repeated multiplications can cause gradients to shrink exponentially (vanish) or grow exponentially (explode).

This means that information from inputs far in the past either gets lost or causes instability during training, limiting the ability of vanilla RNNs to learn long-term dependencies.



## 3. üß† Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

To overcome the gradient problems of vanilla RNNs, **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks were introduced. LSTMs are a special kind of RNN designed to **remember information for long periods** and avoid vanishing gradients.

#### What makes LSTM different?

Unlike vanilla RNNs that use a single hidden state updated multiplicatively (via \( \tanh \)), LSTMs use a **cell state** that runs through the network with only minor linear interactions. This cell state acts like a conveyor belt, allowing information to flow unchanged unless explicitly modified by special structures called **gates**.

#### The role of gates in LSTM

Gates are neural network layers with sigmoid activations that output values between 0 and 1, representing how much information to let through:

- **Forget gate:** Decides what information to discard from the cell state.
- **Input gate:** Decides what new information to add to the cell state.
- **Output gate:** Decides what part of the cell state to output as the hidden state.

These gates allow the LSTM to **add or remove information selectively**, enabling it to keep important information over long sequences and forget irrelevant details.

#### Step-by-step LSTM operation (example)

Consider the sentence:  
*"Saman studies at UOM. His sister studies at UOC. She studies law."*

- **Step 1: Forget gate**  
  When the LSTM reads "sister," it needs to forget information about "Saman" (e.g., gender or subject identity) that is no longer relevant. The forget gate looks at the previous hidden state \( h_{t-1} \) and current input \( x_t \) and outputs a number between 0 and 1 for each element in the cell state \( C_{t-1} \). A 0 means "forget this," and a 1 means "keep this."

- **Step 2: Input gate**  
  The input gate decides what new information to add. It looks at \( h_{t-1} \) and \( x_t \) and outputs a vector of values between 0 and 1. Simultaneously, a candidate vector \( \tilde{C}_t \) is created using a \( \tanh \) layer, representing new information that could be added to the cell state.

- **Step 3: Update cell state**  
  The old cell state \( C_{t-1} \) is updated by forgetting some parts (multiplying by the forget gate output) and adding new candidate information (scaled by the input gate output):

  \[
  C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * \tilde{C}_t
  \]

- **Step 4: Output hidden state**  
  The output gate decides what part of the cell state to output as the hidden state \( h_t \). The cell state is passed through a \( \tanh \) function to squash values between -1 and 1, and then multiplied by the output gate values:

  \[
  h_t = o_t * \tanh(C_t)
  \]

This process allows the LSTM to maintain and update information over long sequences effectively.

#### Why does LSTM solve the vanishing gradient problem?

Because the cell state updates are **additive** rather than multiplicative, gradients can flow backward through many time steps without shrinking to zero. This uninterrupted gradient flow allows the network to learn long-term dependencies.



## 4. üîÑ Variants of LSTM: Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

The **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** is a simpler alternative to LSTM that combines some gates and merges the cell and hidden states into a single state. It has fewer parameters and often trains faster while achieving similar performance.

#### How does GRU work?

- **Update gate \( z_t \):** Controls how much of the previous state to keep versus how much new information to add.
- **Reset gate \( r_t \):** Controls how much of the past information to forget when computing the new candidate state.
- **Candidate state \( \tilde{h}_t \):** New information computed based on the reset gate.
- **New state \( h_t \):** Combines the old state and candidate state based on the update gate.

GRUs are popular because they are computationally simpler but still effective for many sequence tasks.



## 5. üîç Beam Search

When generating sequences (like text), we want to find the most likely sequence of outputs. However, simply choosing the most probable next word at each step (greedy search) can lead to suboptimal overall sequences.

**Beam Search** is a heuristic search algorithm that keeps track of the top \( k \) most probable sequences at each step (called the beam width). Instead of committing to a single best word, it explores multiple possibilities, balancing exploration and exploitation to find better overall sequences.



## 6. üéØ Attention Mechanism

One limitation of RNNs and LSTMs is that they try to encode the entire input sequence into a single fixed-size hidden state, which can be problematic for long sequences (e.g., long sentences in translation).

**Attention** allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating each output element, rather than relying on a single summary vector.

#### How does attention work?

- For each output word \( y_j \), the model computes **attention weights** \( \alpha_{ij} \) over all input hidden states \( h_i \).
- These weights represent how much the output at position \( j \) should "pay attention" to each input position \( i \).
- The context vector \( C_j \) for output \( y_j \) is a weighted sum of the input hidden states:

\[
C_j = \sum_i \alpha_{ij} h_i
\]

- The attention weights \( \alpha_{ij} \) are computed using a small neural network (often a feedforward network) that scores the relevance of \( h_i \) to the current output step.

#### Why is attention useful?

- It allows the model to dynamically select relevant parts of the input for each output.
- It improves performance on long sequences by avoiding the bottleneck of compressing all information into one vector.
- It mimics how humans translate or process sequences by focusing on chunks rather than the entire sequence at once.



## 7. ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations of LSTM and RNNs

Despite their improvements, LSTMs and RNNs still have some drawbacks:

- They **cannot handle very long sequences** efficiently because of sequential processing and memory constraints.
- They **cannot be trained in parallel** easily since each time step depends on the previous one, making training slow.
- These limitations motivated the development of **Transformer models**, which use attention mechanisms extensively and allow parallel processing.



## Summary

- RNNs are designed for sequential data but suffer from vanishing/exploding gradients.
- LSTMs solve this by introducing a cell state and gates that control information flow, enabling learning of long-term dependencies.
- GRUs are a simpler variant of LSTMs with fewer parameters.
- Beam search improves sequence generation by exploring multiple candidate sequences.
- Attention mechanisms allow models to focus on relevant parts of the input dynamically, improving performance on long sequences.
- Despite their strengths, RNNs and LSTMs have limitations that led to the rise of Transformer architectures.
