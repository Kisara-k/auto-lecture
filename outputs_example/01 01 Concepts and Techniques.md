## üìä **Getting to Know Your Data: Concepts and Techniques**

This study note introduces the fundamental ideas and methods used in understanding and analyzing data, which is a crucial first step in data mining. The goal is to help you grasp what data objects are, how to describe them statistically, visualize them effectively, and measure how similar or different they are. These concepts form the foundation for more advanced data analysis and mining techniques.



### 1. üß© **Data Objects and Attribute Types**

#### Introduction
Data objects are the entities or items you are studying, and each object is characterized by attributes‚Äîfeatures or properties that describe it. Understanding what kind of data you have (attributes) is essential because it influences how you analyze and interpret the data.

#### Data Objects
- Think of data objects as the "things" in your dataset‚Äîlike customers, products, patients, or documents.
- Each object is described by multiple attributes, which are the features or characteristics of that object.
- For example, in a customer database, each customer (object) might have attributes like age, gender, income, and location.

#### Attribute Types
Attributes can be of different types, depending on the kind of data they hold:

- **Nominal (Categorical):** These are categories or labels with no inherent order. Examples: hair color, marital status, zip code.
- **Binary:** A special case of nominal with only two possible values, e.g., yes/no, male/female, 0/1.
- **Ordinal:** Attributes with a meaningful order but no fixed interval between values. Examples: rankings, sizes (small, medium, large).
- **Numeric (Quantitative):** These are measurable quantities, divided into:
  - **Interval-scaled:** Numeric data with meaningful differences but no true zero (e.g., temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit).
  - **Ratio-scaled:** Numeric data with a true zero point, allowing for ratios (e.g., height, weight, income).

#### Discrete vs. Continuous Attributes
- **Discrete Attributes:** Have a finite or countably infinite set of values, like number of children or zip codes.
- **Continuous Attributes:** Can take any real value within a range, like height or temperature.



### 2. üßÆ **Basic Statistical Descriptions of Data**

#### Introduction
To understand your data better, you need to summarize its main characteristics‚Äîcentral tendency, spread, and outliers. These summaries help identify patterns, anomalies, and the overall distribution.

#### Measures of Central Tendency
- **Mean (Average):** The sum of all values divided by the number of values. It gives a typical value but can be affected by outliers.
- **Median:** The middle value when data is sorted. It is more robust to outliers and skewed data.
- **Mode:** The most frequently occurring value(s). Useful for categorical data.

#### Measures of Dispersion
- **Range:** Difference between maximum and minimum values.
- **Quartiles (Q1, Q3):** Values dividing data into four equal parts; Q1 is the 25th percentile, Q3 the 75th.
- **Interquartile Range (IQR):** Q3 - Q1; measures the middle 50% spread.
- **Variance and Standard Deviation:** Quantify how much data varies around the mean. Variance is the average squared deviation; standard deviation is its square root.

#### Outliers
- Data points that fall far outside the typical range.
- Identified using boxplots or the IQR method (points beyond 1.5√óIQR are often considered outliers).

#### Visual Tools
- **Boxplot:** Visual summary showing median, quartiles, and outliers.
- **Histogram:** Shows frequency distribution of data.
- **Quantile Plot:** Displays data percentiles.
- **Q-Q Plot:** Compares distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other.



### 3. üé® **Data Visualization**

#### Introduction
Visualizing data helps us see patterns, trends, and anomalies that might be hidden in raw numbers. It provides an intuitive understanding of the data's structure.

#### Types of Visualization
- **Boxplots:** Show data spread and outliers.
- **Histograms:** Display frequency of data within intervals.
- **Scatter Plots:** Show relationships between two variables, revealing clusters or correlations.
- **Quantile and Q-Q Plots:** Compare distributions or assess normality.
- **Histograms vs. Boxplots:** Histograms can reveal the shape of the data distribution, while boxplots focus on spread and outliers.

#### Advanced Visualization Techniques
- **Pixel-oriented:** Map each data dimension to pixels, useful for high-dimensional data.
- **Geometric projections:** Use scatterplots, landscapes, or parallel coordinates to visualize multiple dimensions.
- **Icon-based:** Use shapes or icons (like Chernoff faces) to encode data features visually.
- **Hierarchical:** Tree-maps, cone trees, and InfoCubes visualize data with hierarchical relationships.



### 4. üîç **Measuring Data Similarity and Dissimilarity**

#### Introduction
Understanding how similar or different data objects are is fundamental in clustering, classification, and anomaly detection.

#### Similarity
- A measure of how alike two objects are.
- Usually scaled between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates identical objects.

#### Dissimilarity (Distance)
- A measure of how different two objects are.
- Lower values mean objects are more similar; zero means identical.

#### Data Matrices
- **Data matrix:** Rows are objects, columns are attributes.
- **Dissimilarity matrix:** Stores pairwise distances between objects, often used in clustering.

#### Types of Measures
- **Nominal attributes:** Use simple matching or binary encoding.
- **Binary attributes:** Use measures like Jaccard coefficient for asymmetric binary data.
- **Numeric attributes:** Use distance metrics like Euclidean, Manhattan, or Minkowski.
- **Ordinal attributes:** Can be treated as interval data after ranking.

#### Standardizing Numeric Data
- **Z-score:** Subtract the mean and divide by standard deviation to normalize data.
- Helps compare attributes with different scales.

#### Distance Measures
- **Euclidean Distance:** Straight-line distance in multi-dimensional space.
- **Manhattan Distance:** Sum of absolute differences (like city blocks).
- **Minkowski Distance:** General form encompassing Euclidean and Manhattan.
- **Hamming Distance:** Counts differing bits in binary vectors.



### 5. üåê **Similarity Measures for Different Data Types**

#### Nominal Attributes
- **Simple matching:** Count how many attributes match.
- **Binary attributes:** Use measures like Jaccard coefficient for asymmetric data.

#### Numeric Attributes
- **Normalized distance:** Use z-scores or min-max scaling.
- **Minkowski distance:** Flexible, with special cases like Manhattan (h=1) and Euclidean (h=2).

#### Ordinal Attributes
- Treat as interval data after ranking.
- Map values to [0,1] and compute distances similarly to numeric data.

#### Attributes of Mixed Types
- Combine different attribute types using weighted formulas.
- For nominal: 0 if same, 1 if different.
- For numeric: normalized distance.
- For ordinal: treat as interval-scaled after ranking.



### 6. üßÆ **Advanced Similarity Measures**

#### Cosine Similarity
- Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors.
- Useful in text analysis (e.g., comparing document term frequencies).
- Formula:  
  \[
  \text{cosine}(d_1, d_2) = \frac{d_1 \cdot d_2}{\|d_1\| \|d_2\|}
  \]
- Values close to 1 indicate high similarity.

#### Example
- Comparing two documents based on word frequency vectors.
- The closer the cosine value to 1, the more similar the documents.



### 7. üìù **Summary**

- Data objects are entities described by various attribute types‚Äînominal, binary, ordinal, interval, ratio.
- Understanding data involves statistical summaries like mean, median, variance, and visual tools like boxplots and histograms.
- Visualizations help reveal patterns, distributions, and relationships.
- Measuring similarity and dissimilarity between objects is key for clustering and classification.
- Different attribute types require different similarity/distance measures, from simple matching to advanced metrics like cosine similarity.
- Standardizing data ensures fair comparisons across attributes with different scales.
