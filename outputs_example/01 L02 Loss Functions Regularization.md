Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized study note based on your lecture content on **Loss Functions and Regularization**. The explanations are clear and thorough, designed to help you understand the key concepts step-by-step.



## 1. üéØ Loss Functions for Classification: Understanding the Basics

When training a machine learning model, especially for classification tasks, one of the most important components is the **loss function** (also called an error function). The loss function measures how well the model‚Äôs predictions match the actual target values. The goal during training is to adjust the model‚Äôs parameters (weights) to minimize this loss, thereby improving the model‚Äôs accuracy.

#### Binary Classification Setup

In binary classification, we have two classes, often labeled as 0 and 1. For each data sample \( n \):

- The **target value** \( t_n \) is the actual class label, which is either 0 or 1.
- The model outputs a prediction \( y_n \), which we interpret as the probability that the sample belongs to class 1, i.e., \( y_n = P(t_n = 1 | \text{inputs}_n) \).

Our objective is to make \( y_n \) as close as possible to the true probability of the sample belonging to class 1.

#### Sigmoid Activation for Binary Classification

To produce a probability output between 0 and 1, the output neuron typically uses a **sigmoid activation function**. The sigmoid function squashes any input value into the range (0,1), making it suitable for representing probabilities.



## 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Loss Functions for Binary Classification: Squared Error vs Cross Entropy

#### Squared Error (SE)

One simple way to measure error is the **squared error**, which calculates the square of the difference between the predicted probability \( y_n \) and the true label \( t_n \):

\[
SE = (t_n - y_n)^2
\]

While this is straightforward, it is **not ideal for classification** because:

- It treats the problem like a regression task rather than classification.
- It is sensitive to outliers, which can disproportionately affect the model.
- It does not align well with the probabilistic interpretation of the output.

#### Cross Entropy Loss (Logistic Loss)

A better loss function for classification is **cross entropy**, which measures the difference between two probability distributions: the true distribution \( p \) (actual labels) and the predicted distribution \( q \) (model outputs).

Cross entropy is defined as:

\[
H(p, q) = - \sum_x p(x) \log q(x)
\]

- When \( p \) and \( q \) are similar, cross entropy is low.
- When they differ significantly, cross entropy is high.

In binary classification, if \( t_n \) is the true label and \( y_n \) is the predicted probability, the cross entropy loss for a single sample is:

\[
\text{Loss} = - \left( t_n \log y_n + (1 - t_n) \log (1 - y_n) \right)
\]

This loss function encourages the model to output probabilities close to the true labels and is more robust and theoretically sound for classification tasks.



## 3. üßÆ Cross Entropy in Practice: Why It Works Better

Cross entropy aligns with the idea of **maximum likelihood estimation** in probabilistic models. It penalizes wrong predictions more heavily when the model is confident but wrong, which helps the model learn faster and more accurately.

For example, if the true label is 1 but the model predicts a probability close to 0, the loss will be very high, pushing the model to correct itself strongly.



## 4. üß© Multi-Class Classification: Extending Cross Entropy with Softmax

When there are more than two classes, the problem becomes **multi-class classification**. Here, the model must assign probabilities to each class, and the sum of these probabilities must be 1.

#### Softmax Activation

To achieve this, the model uses a **softmax layer** at the output. The softmax function converts raw scores (logits) for each class into probabilities:

\[
\text{softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j} e^{z_j}}
\]

where \( z_i \) is the score for class \( i \).

#### Cross Entropy with Softmax

The cross entropy loss for multi-class classification is:

\[
\text{Loss} = - \sum_{i} t_i \log y_i
\]

where:

- \( t_i \) is 1 if the sample belongs to class \( i \), else 0.
- \( y_i \) is the predicted probability for class \( i \) after softmax.

This combination of softmax activation and cross entropy loss is the standard approach for multi-class classification problems.



## 5. üõ°Ô∏è Regularization: Improving Model Generalization

#### What is Regularization?

Regularization refers to techniques that help a model perform well **not only on the training data but also on new, unseen data** (test data). The main goal is to reduce **generalization error**, which is the difference between performance on training data and unseen data.

Without regularization, models can **overfit** ‚Äî they learn the training data too well, including noise and outliers, and fail to generalize. Conversely, **underfitting** happens when the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns.

#### How Regularization Works

Regularization adds a **penalty term** to the loss function that discourages overly complex models. Instead of minimizing just the error \( J(w) \), we minimize:

\[
J(w) + \lambda \Omega(w)
\]

where:

- \( J(w) \) is the original loss function (e.g., cross entropy).
- \( \Omega(w) \) is the regularization term, a function of the model parameters \( w \).
- \( \lambda \) is a hyperparameter controlling the strength of regularization.



## 6. ‚öñÔ∏è Types of Regularization: L2 and L1 Norms

#### L2 Regularization (Ridge)

L2 regularization adds a penalty proportional to the **sum of the squares of the weights**:

\[
\Omega(w) = \sum_i w_i^2
\]

This encourages the model to keep weights small but rarely drives them exactly to zero. It helps with numerical stability, especially in cases where the data has many features but few samples.

#### L1 Regularization (Lasso)

L1 regularization adds a penalty proportional to the **sum of the absolute values of the weights**:

\[
\Omega(w) = \sum_i |w_i|
\]

L1 regularization tends to push some weights exactly to zero, effectively performing **feature selection** by eliminating less important features. This results in a **sparse model**, which can be easier to interpret and sometimes more efficient.

#### Comparing L1 and L2

- **L2**: Shrinks weights smoothly, keeps all features but with smaller values.
- **L1**: Encourages sparsity by zeroing out some weights, leading to simpler models.

Both methods help prevent overfitting by controlling model complexity.



## 7. üîç Visualizing Regularization Effects

Imagine fitting a polynomial curve to data points:

- Without regularization, the model might fit a very high-degree polynomial that perfectly matches training points but wiggles wildly between them (overfitting).
- With regularization, the model is encouraged to find a smoother curve that captures the general trend without fitting noise.

This balance is crucial for building models that generalize well.



## Summary

- **Loss functions** measure how well a model‚Äôs predictions match actual labels.
- For **binary classification**, cross entropy loss with sigmoid activation is preferred over squared error because it better models probabilities and penalizes wrong confident predictions.
- For **multi-class classification**, softmax activation combined with cross entropy loss is standard.
- **Regularization** techniques add penalties to the loss function to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
- **L2 regularization** penalizes large weights, promoting smaller but non-zero weights.
- **L1 regularization** promotes sparsity by pushing some weights to zero, effectively selecting features.
