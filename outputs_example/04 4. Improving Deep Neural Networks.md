## Study Notes: Improving Deep Neural Networks



### 1. üß† Improving the Performance of Deep Neural Networks

When working with deep neural networks (DNNs), improving their performance is crucial to achieve better accuracy and generalization. This section covers several important techniques that help make deep networks train faster, avoid overfitting, and generalize better to new data.

#### Why Improve Deep Neural Networks?

Deep networks can be powerful but also tricky to train effectively. They often suffer from problems like slow convergence, overfitting, and unstable training. To address these, researchers have developed methods such as normalization, dropout, early stopping, and data augmentation.



### 2. ‚öñÔ∏è Normalizing Inputs and Intermediate Layers

#### Normalizing Inputs

Normalization means adjusting the input data so that it has a mean (average) of zero and a standard deviation (spread) of one. This is done by subtracting the mean (Œº) and dividing by the standard deviation (œÉ) calculated from the training data. Importantly, the same Œº and œÉ must be used to normalize the test data to keep consistency.

**Why normalize inputs?**  
- It helps the network learn faster and more reliably because the inputs are on a similar scale.
- Prevents some features from dominating others due to scale differences.

#### Normalization for Intermediate Layers: Batch Normalization

Normalization is not only useful at the input layer but also inside the network, between layers. This is called **Batch Normalization**.

- Batch normalization normalizes the weighted sums (often called pre-activations or Y's) of a layer before passing them through the activation function.
- It adjusts these values to have zero mean and unit variance **within each mini-batch** during training.
- This reduces the problem called **internal covariate shift**, where the distribution of inputs to each layer changes during training, making learning harder.
- There is some debate about whether to normalize before or after the activation function, but normalizing **before** activation is currently more common.

#### Scaling After Normalization

Simply normalizing to zero mean and unit variance is not always ideal. Batch normalization introduces **learnable parameters** that scale and shift the normalized values, allowing the network to restore any necessary distribution if needed.



### 3. ‚ùå Dropout: Preventing Overfitting by Randomly Dropping Neurons

Dropout is a simple but powerful regularization technique to prevent overfitting, which happens when a model learns the training data too well but performs poorly on new data.

- During training, dropout randomly "drops" (sets to zero) some neurons and their connections with a probability of (1 - p), where p is the probability of keeping a neuron.
- This forces the network to not rely too heavily on any single neuron, encouraging redundancy and robustness.
- At test time, dropout is turned off, but the outgoing weights of neurons are scaled by p to account for the missing neurons during training.

This technique was introduced by Srivastava et al. (2014) and has become a standard method to improve generalization.



### 4. ‚èπÔ∏è Early Stopping: Avoiding Overfitting by Monitoring Validation Error

Early stopping is a simple yet effective way to prevent overfitting by stopping training at the right time.

- During training, the model‚Äôs performance is monitored on a separate **validation set**.
- When the validation error starts to increase (even if training error continues to decrease), it indicates the model is beginning to overfit.
- Training is stopped **before** the training error reaches its minimum to keep the model generalizable.



### 5. üîÑ Data Augmentation: Creating More Training Data

Data augmentation artificially increases the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the original data, such as rotations, flips, scaling, or color changes.

- This technique helps the model learn to generalize better by exposing it to more varied examples.
- While not as good as collecting new real data, it is much cheaper and easier.
- Models trained on augmented data tend to perform better on unseen data.



### 6. üèóÔ∏è Improved Architectures for Deep Neural Networks

As networks get deeper, they face new challenges that require architectural innovations.

#### Problems with Typical Deep CNNs

- **Exploding/Vanishing Gradients:** Gradients become too large or too small during backpropagation, making training unstable or slow.
- **Degradation Problem:** Beyond a certain depth, adding more layers causes accuracy to saturate and then degrade, even on training data. This is not due to overfitting but because deeper layers fail to learn useful functions.

#### Why Does the Degradation Problem Occur?

- Intuitively, adding layers should not reduce training accuracy because extra layers can learn the identity function (output = input), leaving performance unchanged.
- However, typical deep networks struggle to learn this identity mapping, causing training accuracy to drop.



### 7. üîó Residual Networks (ResNets): Solving the Degradation Problem

ResNets introduce **identity shortcut connections** that skip one or more layers, allowing the network to learn residual functions instead of direct mappings.

#### Key Idea

- Let \( H(X) \) be the desired underlying mapping.
- Instead of learning \( H(X) \) directly, the network learns a residual function \( F(X) = H(X) - X \).
- The output is then \( Y = F(X) + X \).
- If the optimal function is close to identity, learning the residual \( F(X) \) is easier than learning \( H(X) \) from scratch.

#### Benefits of ResNets

- Helps avoid the degradation problem by making it easier to learn identity mappings.
- Provides direct paths for gradients to flow backward, reducing vanishing gradient issues.
- Can be built with blocks of 2 or 3 layers; single-layer residual blocks are less effective.

#### When Dimensions Don‚Äôt Match

- If the input and output dimensions differ, a linear projection \( W_s \) is applied to \( X \) to match dimensions before addition:  
  \( Y = F(X) + W_s X \).

#### Experimental Results

- ResNets outperform plain networks of the same depth on large datasets like ImageNet.
- They achieve lower training and validation errors without increasing the number of parameters.



### 8. üåê Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets)

DenseNets take the idea of shortcut connections further by connecting **every layer to every other layer** in a feed-forward fashion.

#### Architecture

- Each layer receives as input the concatenation of the outputs of all preceding layers.
- This is different from ResNets, which add outputs; DenseNets concatenate them.
- Because of concatenation, feature map sizes must be consistent within a dense block.

#### Advantages of DenseNets

- **Fewer parameters:** Since each layer can access all previous feature maps directly, it needs to produce fewer new feature maps.
- **Improved gradient flow:** Direct connections help gradients flow back easily, alleviating vanishing gradients.
- **Better feature reuse:** Layers can reuse features from all previous layers, improving efficiency.

#### Why Fewer Parameters?

- Traditional networks require each layer to both preserve previous information and add new information, leading to many feature maps and parameters.
- DenseNets separate these concerns by passing previous information directly, so each layer only needs to add a small number of new feature maps.

#### Mapping Function in DenseNets

- Let \( H_l \) be the function computed by layer \( l \) (e.g., batch norm, ReLU, convolution).
- The output of layer \( l \) is:  
  \[
  X_l = H_l([X_0, X_1, ..., X_{l-1}])
  \]
  where \([X_0, X_1, ..., X_{l-1}]\) is the concatenation of all previous layers‚Äô outputs.

#### Multiple Dense Blocks and Transition Layers

- DenseNets are organized into dense blocks separated by **transition layers**.
- Transition layers reduce the size of feature maps using batch normalization, 1x1 convolutions, and 2x2 average pooling.
- This allows the network to downsample feature maps while maintaining dense connectivity within blocks.

#### Experimental Results

- DenseNets achieve lower error rates than ResNets on ImageNet with fewer parameters and less computation (FLOPs).
- They are efficient and effective for deep learning tasks.
