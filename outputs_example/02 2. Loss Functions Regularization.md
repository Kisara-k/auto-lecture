Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized study note based on your lecture content on **Loss Functions and Regularization**. The explanations are clear and thorough, designed to help you understand the key concepts step-by-step.



## 1. üéØ Loss Functions for Classification: Understanding the Basics

When training a machine learning model, especially for classification tasks, one of the most important components is the **loss function** (also called an error function). The loss function measures how well the model‚Äôs predictions match the actual target values. The goal during training is to adjust the model‚Äôs parameters (weights) to minimize this loss, thereby improving the model‚Äôs accuracy.

#### Binary Classification Setup

In binary classification, we have two classes, often labeled as 0 and 1. For each data sample \( n \):

- The **target value** \( t_n \) is the actual class label, which is either 0 or 1.
- The model outputs a prediction \( y_n \), which we interpret as the probability that the sample belongs to class 1, i.e., \( y_n = P(t_n = 1 | \text{inputs}_n) \).

The model‚Äôs output \( y_n \) is typically produced by a **sigmoid activation function** in the output neuron. The sigmoid function squashes any input into a value between 0 and 1, making it suitable to represent probabilities.

#### Why do we need a loss function?

We want \( y_n \) to be as close as possible to the true probability \( P(t_n = 1 | \text{inputs}_n) \). To achieve this, we define a loss function that quantifies the difference between the predicted probability \( y_n \) and the actual label \( t_n \). The training process then tries to minimize this loss by adjusting the model‚Äôs weights.



## 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Loss Functions for Binary Classification: Squared Error vs Cross Entropy

#### Squared Error Loss (SE)

One simple way to measure error is the **squared error**:

\[
SE = (t_n - y_n)^2
\]

This measures the square of the difference between the true label and the predicted probability. While intuitive and easy to compute, squared error loss is **not ideal for classification** because:

- It treats the problem like a regression task rather than classification.
- It is sensitive to outliers, which can disproportionately affect the model.
- It can lead to slow or unstable training when used with sigmoid outputs.

#### Cross Entropy Loss with Logistic Loss

A better loss function for binary classification is **cross entropy loss**, often called **logistic loss** when combined with a sigmoid output.

Cross entropy measures the difference between two probability distributions: the true distribution \( p \) (actual labels) and the predicted distribution \( q \) (model outputs). It is defined as:

\[
H(p, q) = - \sum p(x) \log q(x)
\]

In our binary case, for each sample:

\[
\text{Cross Entropy Loss} = - \left[ t_n \log y_n + (1 - t_n) \log (1 - y_n) \right]
\]

- When the predicted probability \( y_n \) is close to the true label \( t_n \), the loss is low.
- When \( y_n \) is far from \( t_n \), the loss is high.

This loss function is **more appropriate for classification** because it directly measures how well the predicted probabilities match the true labels, and it works well with sigmoid outputs.



## 3. üß© Multi-Class Classification and Softmax with Cross Entropy

When there are more than two classes, the problem becomes **multi-class classification**. Here, each sample belongs to exactly one class out of \( K \) possible classes.

#### Softmax Activation

To handle multiple classes, the model‚Äôs output layer uses a **softmax function** instead of sigmoid. The softmax function converts raw scores (logits) for each class into probabilities that sum to 1:

\[
\text{softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^K e^{z_j}}
\]

where \( z_i \) is the score for class \( i \).

#### Cross Entropy Loss for Multi-Class

The cross entropy loss generalizes to multi-class as:

\[
\text{Loss} = - \sum_{i=1}^K t_i \log y_i
\]

where:

- \( t_i \) is 1 if the sample belongs to class \( i \), else 0.
- \( y_i \) is the predicted probability for class \( i \) from the softmax.

This loss encourages the model to assign high probability to the correct class and low probability to others.



## 4. üõ°Ô∏è Regularization: Improving Model Generalization

#### What is Regularization?

Regularization refers to techniques that help a model perform well **not only on the training data but also on new, unseen data** (test data). The main goal is to reduce **generalization error**, which is the difference between performance on training data and test data.

Without regularization, models can **overfit** ‚Äî they learn the training data too well, including noise and outliers, and fail to generalize. Conversely, **underfitting** happens when the model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern.

#### How does regularization work?

Regularization adds a **penalty term** to the loss function that discourages overly complex models. Instead of minimizing just the error \( J(w) \), we minimize:

\[
J(w) + \lambda \Omega(w)
\]

where:

- \( J(w) \) is the original loss function (e.g., cross entropy).
- \( \Omega(w) \) is a penalty function that depends on the model parameters \( w \).
- \( \lambda \) is a hyperparameter controlling the strength of regularization.



## 5. üîç Types of Regularization: L2 and L1 Norm Penalties

#### L2 Regularization (Ridge)

L2 regularization adds a penalty proportional to the **sum of the squares of the weights**:

\[
\Omega(w) = \sum_i w_i^2
\]

The objective becomes:

\[
\min_w J(w) + \lambda \sum_i w_i^2
\]

- This encourages weights to be small but rarely zero.
- It helps stabilize training, especially when data is high-dimensional or poorly conditioned.
- It tends to spread out the "importance" across many features.

#### L1 Regularization (Lasso)

L1 regularization adds a penalty proportional to the **sum of the absolute values of the weights**:

\[
\Omega(w) = \sum_i |w_i|
\]

The objective becomes:

\[
\min_w J(w) + \lambda \sum_i |w_i|
\]

- L1 regularization encourages sparsity, meaning it pushes many weights exactly to zero.
- This effectively performs feature selection by eliminating unimportant features.
- It can produce simpler, more interpretable models.

#### Comparing L1 and L2

- Both methods aim to simplify the model and prevent overfitting.
- L2 shrinks weights smoothly, keeping all features but with smaller values.
- L1 aggressively zeros out less important weights, leading to sparse models.



## Summary

- **Loss functions** measure how well a model‚Äôs predictions match actual labels. For classification, **cross entropy loss** is preferred over squared error because it better handles probabilities and improves training stability.
- For **binary classification**, cross entropy with sigmoid output is standard.
- For **multi-class classification**, softmax activation combined with cross entropy loss is used.
- **Regularization** helps models generalize better by adding a penalty to the loss function, discouraging overly complex models.
- The two main types of regularization are **L2 (ridge)** and **L1 (lasso)**, with L1 promoting sparsity and L2 promoting small but non-zero weights.
