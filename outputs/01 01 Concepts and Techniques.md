## üìä **Getting to Know Your Data: Concepts and Techniques**

This study note introduces the fundamental ideas and methods used in understanding and analyzing data in data mining. It covers the types of data objects, attributes, statistical descriptions, visualization techniques, and measures of similarity and dissimilarity. These are essential steps in preparing data for further analysis and extracting meaningful insights.



### 1. üß© **Data Objects and Attribute Types**

#### Introduction
Data objects are the entities or items we analyze, and each object is described by attributes‚Äîfeatures or characteristics. Understanding what kind of data we have (its type) is crucial because it influences how we analyze and interpret it.

#### Data Objects
- Think of data objects as the "things" or "entities" in your dataset. For example:
  - Customers in a sales database
  - Patients in a medical database
  - Students in a university database
- Each object is represented as a row in a database table, with columns representing attributes.

#### Attribute Types
Attributes describe the properties of data objects. They can be of various types, each requiring different handling:

- **Nominal Attributes**: These are categories or labels without any inherent order.
  - Example: Hair color (auburn, black, blond), marital status, occupation.
  - They are simply names or labels, e.g., ID numbers or zip codes.
  
- **Binary Attributes**: A special case of nominal attributes with only two possible values.
  - Symmetric binary: Both outcomes are equally important, e.g., gender (male/female).
  - Asymmetric binary: Outcomes are not equally important, e.g., medical test results (positive/negative). Usually, assign 1 to the more important outcome.

- **Ordinal Attributes**: These have a meaningful order but the difference between values isn't necessarily known.
  - Example: Size (small, medium, large), rankings, grades.
  - The key is the order, not the magnitude of difference.

- **Numeric Attributes**: Quantitative data that can be measured.
  - **Interval-scaled**: Values have order and equal intervals but no true zero (e.g., temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit).
  - **Ratio-scaled**: Values have order, equal intervals, and a meaningful zero point (e.g., height, weight, income).

#### Discrete vs. Continuous Attributes
- **Discrete Attributes**: Finite or countably infinite set of values, often integers.
  - Example: Number of children, zip codes.
- **Continuous Attributes**: Real numbers, can take any value within a range.
  - Example: Height, temperature, weight.



### 2. üìà **Basic Statistical Descriptions of Data**

#### Introduction
To understand your data better, you analyze its central tendency, spread, and distribution. These statistical summaries help identify patterns, outliers, and the overall shape of the data.

#### Measures of Central Tendency
- **Mean (Average)**: Sum of all values divided by the number of values. Useful for symmetric data.
- **Median**: The middle value when data is sorted; less affected by outliers.
- **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value(s).

#### Measures of Dispersion
- **Range**: Difference between maximum and minimum.
- **Quartiles**: Values dividing data into four equal parts:
  - Q1 (25th percentile)
  - Q2 (median, 50th percentile)
  - Q3 (75th percentile)
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Q3 - Q1, measures the middle 50% spread.
- **Variance and Standard Deviation**: Quantify how much data varies around the mean.
  - Variance: Average squared deviation from the mean.
  - Standard deviation: Square root of variance, in the same units as data.

#### Outliers
- Values that fall outside the typical range, often beyond 1.5√óIQR from Q1 or Q3.
- Visualized using **boxplots**.



### 3. üé® **Data Visualization**

#### Introduction
Visual tools help us see patterns, trends, and anomalies in data that might be hard to detect numerically. Visualization makes data more accessible and interpretable.

#### Common Visualization Techniques
- **Boxplot**: Shows the five-number summary (min, Q1, median, Q3, max) and outliers.
- **Histogram**: Displays frequency distribution of data; useful for understanding the shape of data distribution.
- **Quantile Plot**: Shows the percentage of data below each value, helping identify distribution shape.
- **Q-Q Plot**: Compares two distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other.
- **Scatter Plot**: Plots pairs of data points to observe relationships, clusters, or outliers.

#### Special Distributions
- **Normal Distribution Curve**: Bell-shaped curve where:
  - About 68% of data falls within 1 standard deviation (Œº ¬± œÉ).
  - About 95% within 2œÉ.
  - About 99.7% within 3œÉ.

#### Visualizing Data Dispersion
- **Histograms** and **boxplots** are particularly useful for understanding data spread and identifying outliers.



### 4. üîç **Measuring Data Similarity and Dissimilarity**

#### Introduction
In data mining, understanding how similar or different data objects are is fundamental. Similarity measures help cluster data, find duplicates, or identify outliers.

#### Similarity
- A numerical value indicating how alike two objects are.
- Usually ranges from 0 (completely different) to 1 (identical).

#### Dissimilarity (Distance)
- Measures how different two objects are.
- Lower values mean objects are more similar; zero indicates identical objects.

#### Data Matrices
- **Data matrix**: Rows are objects, columns are attributes.
- **Dissimilarity matrix**: Stores pairwise distances between objects, often used in clustering.

#### Proximity Measures
- **Nominal Attributes**:
  - **Simple matching**: Counts how many attribute values match.
  - **Binary attributes**:
    - Symmetric: Both outcomes equally important.
    - Asymmetric: One outcome more significant (e.g., presence/absence).

- **Numeric Attributes**:
  - **Z-score standardization**: Converts raw data to a standard scale based on mean and standard deviation.
  - **Distance measures**:
    - **Euclidean distance**: Straight-line distance.
    - **Manhattan distance**: Sum of absolute differences.
    - **Minkowski distance**: General form encompassing both Euclidean and Manhattan.

- **Ordinal Attributes**:
  - Can be treated like interval data after ranking and normalization.

- **Mixed Attributes**:
  - Combine different attribute types using weighted formulas.

#### Similarity for Text and High-Dimensional Data
- **Cosine similarity**: Measures the angle between two vectors, useful in text analysis.
  - Example: Comparing term-frequency vectors of documents.



### 5. üßÆ **Standardizing and Computing Distances**

#### Standardization
- Converts different scales to a common scale.
- **Z-score**: (value - mean) / standard deviation.
- Helps compare attributes with different units or ranges.

#### Distance Measures
- **Minkowski Distance**:
  - General form with parameter h.
  - Special cases:
    - h=1: Manhattan distance.
    - h=2: Euclidean distance.
    - h‚Üí‚àû: Maximum difference (Lmax norm).

#### Handling Different Attribute Types
- Nominal: Use matching or binary similarity.
- Numeric: Use normalized distances.
- Ordinal: Convert to ranks before measuring.



### 6. üåê **Applications and Summary**

#### Summary
- Data objects are entities described by various attribute types.
- Understanding data involves statistical summaries, visualization, and similarity measures.
- These steps are part of data preprocessing, preparing data for more advanced analysis like clustering, classification, or pattern discovery.

#### Why It Matters
- Proper understanding of data types and distributions helps choose the right analysis methods.
- Visualization reveals hidden patterns.
- Similarity measures enable grouping, anomaly detection, and recommendation systems.
