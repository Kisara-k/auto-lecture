## üìà Time Series Part 1: Introduction and Foundations



### 1. Introduction to Time Series (TS) üìÖ

**What is a Time Series?**  
A time series is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at regular, equally spaced time intervals. Think of it as a record of how a particular variable changes over time. Examples include daily stock prices, monthly sales, hourly temperature readings, or yearly sunspot activity.

**Why is understanding TS important?**  
Analyzing time series helps us identify patterns, trends, and seasonal effects, which are crucial for making predictions about future events. For example, businesses forecast sales, weather agencies predict climate changes, and financial analysts forecast stock prices.

**Characteristics of Time Series Data:**  
- The data points are ordered in time.  
- The mean and standard deviation can vary over time (not necessarily constant).  
- The data often exhibits patterns like trends, seasonality, cycles, and noise.



### 2. Types of Data in Time Series üåç

**Examples of Time Series Data:**  
- Sunspot numbers over centuries (solar activity).  
- Electricity demand measured every half-hour.  
- Daily temperature readings.  
- Monthly retail sales figures.

**Difference from Random Variables:**  
While a random variable with a known distribution can be sampled to generate data points, a time series often depends on its past values‚Äîthis is called *dependence* or *memory*. For example, today's temperature depends on yesterday's temperature, not just a random draw.



### 3. Dependence and Memory in Time Series üß†

**Memory of a TS:**  
Refers to how much past data influences future data points.  

- **Short memory:** Only recent past values matter (e.g., stock prices).  
- **Long memory:** Distant past values influence future (e.g., climate data).  

**Autocorrelation:**  
A key concept measuring the correlation between a time series and its lagged versions.  
- If autocorrelation at lag *k* is high, the value *k* steps before influences the current value.  
- Significant spikes at specific lags indicate seasonality or cycles.



### 4. Components of a Time Series üß©

A time series can be broken down into several components:

- **Level:** The average value around which the data fluctuates.  
- **Trend:** The long-term increase or decrease over time.  
- **Cycle:** Long-term, irregular oscillations that are not fixed in period (e.g., economic recessions).  
- **Seasonality:** Regular, repeating short-term patterns (e.g., monthly sales peaks).  
- **Noise:** Random, unsystematic variations or errors.

Understanding these helps in modeling and forecasting.



### 5. Detecting and Analyzing Components üîç

#### Trend Detection  
Methods include moving averages, polynomial fitting, or more advanced smoothing techniques.  
- **Moving averages:** Smooth out short-term fluctuations to reveal the underlying trend.  
- **Polynomial fitting:** Fit a polynomial curve to capture nonlinear trends.

#### Seasonality Detection  
Methods include:  
- **Autocorrelation plots:** Look for spikes at specific lags (e.g., lag 12 for yearly seasonality in monthly data).  
- **FFT (Fast Fourier Transform):** Converts data into frequency domain to identify dominant seasonal frequencies.  
- **Seasonal decomposition:** Breaks down the series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.



### 6. Decomposition of Time Series üìä

**Why decompose?**  
To better understand the underlying patterns and improve forecasting accuracy.

#### Types of Models:
- **Additive:** \( y(t) = \text{Level} + \text{Trend} + \text{Seasonality} + \text{Noise} \)  
- **Multiplicative:** \( y(t) = \text{Level} \times \text{Trend} \times \text{Seasonality} \times \text{Noise} \)

Real-world data often contains a mix of both.

#### Techniques for Decomposition:
- **LOESS (Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing):**  
  A non-parametric method that fits smooth curves locally, capturing trends and seasonality without assuming a specific model.

- **STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using LOESS):**  
  A popular method that extracts trend and seasonal components separately, allowing for flexible modeling of complex data.

**Steps in STL:**
1. Apply LOESS to extract the trend component.  
2. Remove the trend from the original series.  
3. Apply LOESS again to the detrended data to extract seasonality.  
4. Calculate residuals (original minus trend and seasonality) to analyze randomness or anomalies.



### 7. Seasonality and Cycles üå¶Ô∏è

#### Seasonality  
- Repeating patterns with fixed periods (monthly, quarterly, yearly).  
- Detected via autocorrelation plots or spectral analysis.  
- Example: Retail sales peaking every December.

#### Cycles  
- Longer, irregular oscillations without fixed periods, often influenced by economic or environmental factors.  
- Detectable through spectral analysis or wavelet transforms.  
- Example: Business cycles lasting several years.



### 8. Spectral Analysis & Cycle Detection üé∂

**Fourier Transform:**  
Transforms the time series into the frequency domain, revealing dominant frequencies (periodicities).  
- Peaks in the spectral density indicate significant cycles or seasonal patterns.

**Wavelet Transform:**  
Decomposes data into different frequency bands, useful for non-stationary data where cycles may vary over time.



### 9. Regression and Time Series Modeling üìù

Regression models can help identify underlying trends and relationships.  
- **Linear regression:** Models the trend over time as a straight line.  
- **Multiple regression:** Incorporates other variables (economic indicators, weather factors).

Time series models often combine regression with decomposition to improve forecasts.



### 10. Stationarity in Time Series ‚öñÔ∏è

**What is stationarity?**  
A stationary time series has statistical properties (mean, variance, autocorrelation) that do not change over time.

**Why is stationarity important?**  
Many forecasting models assume stationarity. Non-stationary data can lead to unreliable predictions.

#### How to check stationarity:
- **Visual inspection:** Look for trends or changing variance.  
- **Summary statistics:** Compare mean and variance over different periods.  
- **Statistical tests:**  
  - **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test:** Checks for unit roots indicating non-stationarity.

#### How to achieve stationarity:
- **Transformations:** Logarithmic, square root, or Box-Cox transforms to stabilize variance.  
- **Differencing:** Subtract current value from previous to remove trends and cycles.



### 11. Transformations to Stabilize Variance üìâ

**Common transformations:**
- **Logarithmic:** Reduces exponential growth effects.  
- **Square root:** Useful for count data or quadratic trends.  
- **Box-Cox:** A flexible family of transformations that includes log and square root as special cases.

**Example:**  
Transforming airline passenger data with a log reduces the effect of exponential growth, making the series more stationary.



### 12. Differencing to Remove Trends and Cycles üîÑ

**What is differencing?**  
Replacing each data point with the difference between it and its previous value.  
- **First-order differencing:** \( y'_t = y_t - y_{t-1} \)  
- **Second-order differencing:** Difference of the first differences.

**Purpose:**  
To eliminate trends and stabilize the mean, making the series stationary.

**Example:**  
Applying differencing to airline passenger data can remove upward trends, revealing underlying seasonal patterns.



### 13. Summary of Key Techniques for Stationarity and Transformation

| Technique | Purpose | How it works | Example |
|||--||
| Log transform | Stabilize variance | Apply log to data | Airline passengers data |  
| Square root | Reduce quadratic growth | Apply sqrt | Count data |  
| Box-Cox | Flexible transformation | Find optimal lambda | Various datasets |  
| Differencing | Remove trend/cycle | Subtract previous value | Airline data |  



### 14. Practical Workflow for Time Series Analysis

1. **Visual Inspection:** Plot data to identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies.  
2. **Decomposition:** Use STL or classical methods to separate components.  
3. **Stationarity Check:** Use plots and statistical tests (ADF).  
4. **Transformations:** Apply log, sqrt, or Box-Cox if needed.  
5. **Differencing:** Remove trends or cycles to achieve stationarity.  
6. **Modeling:** Use models like ARIMA, regression, or advanced methods for forecasting.  
7. **Validation:** Check residuals for randomness and model accuracy.



### 15. Final Notes

Understanding and preparing time series data is crucial before applying forecasting models. Recognizing patterns like trend, seasonality, and cycles, and ensuring stationarity, helps in building accurate and reliable models. Techniques like decomposition, spectral analysis, transformations, and differencing are essential tools in this process.
