## üìö Data Mining: An Introduction



### 1. Introduction to Data Mining

**Data mining** is a process of discovering useful, often unexpected, patterns or knowledge from large amounts of data. It is a key step in transforming raw data into valuable insights, which can support decision-making across various fields like business, science, and society.

#### Why is Data Mining Important?
- **Explosion of Data**: With the rise of the internet, e-commerce, scientific instruments, and social media, data is growing exponentially‚Äîfrom terabytes to petabytes.
- **Data Availability**: Automated tools, databases, and web sources make vast data accessible.
- **Need for Knowledge**: Despite having tons of data, organizations and scientists struggle to extract meaningful knowledge without automated methods.

#### Evolution of Sciences
- **Empirical Science (before 1600)**: Based on observation and experiments.
- **Theoretical Science (1600-1950s)**: Development of models and theories.
- **Computational Science (1950s-1990s)**: Use of computers for simulations and complex calculations.
- **Data Science (1990s-present)**: Handling massive data from new instruments, the internet, and simulations, requiring new tools like data mining.

#### Historical Context of Data Mining
- Data mining is a **new scientific challenge** driven by the need to analyze large, complex datasets efficiently.
- It is a **confluence** of multiple disciplines: machine learning, statistics, database technology, pattern recognition, and visualization.



### 2. What Is Data Mining? üåü

**Data mining** is often called **Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)**. It involves extracting **interesting, non-trivial, implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful patterns** from large datasets.

#### Key Points:
- It is **not just simple querying** or search.
- It involves **automated or semi-automated analysis** to find hidden patterns.
- The goal is to turn data into **knowledge** that can support decision-making.

#### Alternative Names:
- Knowledge discovery
- Knowledge extraction
- Data/pattern analysis
- Data archaeology
- Data dredging
- Business intelligence

#### Is Everything "Data Mining"?
- No. Simple searches, expert systems, or rule-based queries are not considered data mining.
- Data mining involves **pattern discovery** beyond straightforward querying.



### 3. The Data Mining Process: Knowledge Discovery Workflow üîç

The process of discovering knowledge from data involves several steps:

- **Data Selection**: Choosing relevant data for analysis.
- **Data Transformation**: Converting data into suitable formats.
- **Data Mining**: Applying algorithms to extract patterns.
- **Pattern Evaluation**: Validating the interestingness and usefulness of patterns.
- **Knowledge Presentation**: Visualizing and presenting results for interpretation.

#### Example: Web Mining Framework
- Data cleaning and integration from multiple sources.
- Warehousing data into a data cube.
- Selecting data for mining.
- Applying data mining techniques.
- Presenting patterns as knowledge for decision-making.



### 4. Data Mining in Business Intelligence üíº

**Business intelligence** uses data mining to support decision-making:
- End users include business analysts, data analysts, and database administrators.
- Data sources include transaction records, web logs, scientific data, and more.
- Techniques include statistical summaries, querying, and visualization.

#### Data Exploration vs. Data Mining
- **Exploration**: Basic reporting, visualization, and ad-hoc queries.
- **Mining**: Automated pattern discovery, such as association rules, classification, clustering, etc.

#### Example: Medical Data Mining
- Preprocessing (feature extraction, dimension reduction).
- Classification (e.g., disease diagnosis).
- Clustering (e.g., patient segmentation).
- Post-processing for presentation.
